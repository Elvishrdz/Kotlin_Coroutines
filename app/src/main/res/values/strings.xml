    <string name="launching_coroutines_default_information">On Android, coroutines are a great solution to two problems:\n A) Long running tasks are tasks that take too long to block the main thread.\n Fetching a webpage or interacting with an API both involve making a network request. Similarly, reading from a database or loading an image from disk involve reading a file.\n\n B) Main-safety allows you to ensure that any suspend function can be called from the main thread.</string>
